## Featured Project: AI Reporting & Audit Flow

### The problem
AI teams often discover data, licensing, or compliance
issues late — when fixes are expensive or impossible.

Legal teams lack visibility.
Product teams lack clear signals.
Risk shows up too late.

### The goal
Design a reporting flow that surfaces risk early,
explains it clearly, and supports informed decisions
before deployment.

---

## What I built

- An AI audit & reporting flow MVP
- Risk flags tied to specific data sources
- A review queue designed for legal + non-legal users
- Clear “what this means” explanations per issue

This is a **design + systems thinking project**,
not a production backend.

## Quality Assurance & Testing Philosophy

I treat QA as a design responsibility, not a final step.

### What I tested
- Core user paths (report → review → decision)
- Clarity of risk explanations
- Visual hierarchy under time pressure
- Error and empty states

### What I didn’t test (yet)
- Real legal team workflows
- Large-scale data volumes
- Automated policy ingestion

These are noted intentionally and would be next
steps in a production build.

## Trust Signals

Each project includes:
- Annotated screens mapped to QA checks
- Known limitations called out clearly
- Design decisions explained in plain language

This helps reviewers understand *why* things look
the way they do — not just *that* they look polished.

---

## Tech notes (lightweight)

- Built as a static site with GitHub Pages
- No frameworks required to view
- Content written to be readable by
  technical and non-technical audiences

## About me

I design systems where clarity matters —
especially when the stakes are high.

This portfolio reflects how I think,
test, and communicate — not just what I ship.
