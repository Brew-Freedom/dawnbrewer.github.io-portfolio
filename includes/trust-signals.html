  <h3>Trust Signals</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Clear status states</strong><br />
      Users can always see whether a report is flagged,
      pending review, or resolved.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>No hidden failures</strong><br />
      Missing or partial data is shown explicitly,
      not silently ignored.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Human-in-the-loop decisions</strong><br />
      The system suggests actions, but humans
      approve every outcome.
    </li>
  </ul>
