# AI Reporting & Audit Flow

I design human-centered systems that make AI risk, data compliance, and decision-making visible **before deployment**, not after.

---

## The Problem

AI teams often discover licensing, data provenance, or compliance issues too late — when fixes are expensive or impossible.

Legal teams lack visibility.  
Product teams lack clear signals.  
Risk shows up at the worst possible time.

---

## The Solution

An AI reporting flow that surfaces risk early, explains it clearly, and routes it to the right humans at the right moment.

## How It Works

1. Training data is continuously evaluated for licensing and source coverage  
2. Risk signals are summarized in a clear audit view  
3. Issues can be escalated to legal or policy teams before deployment  
4. Teams ship with confidence — or pause with evidence
