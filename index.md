# Dawn Brewer  
## Product & UX Design for High-Stakes Systems

I design for clarity first — then validate that clarity
holds up under real-world constraints.

## AI Reporting Flow  
### Making AI risk visible before it becomes a problem

### The problem
AI teams often discover compliance, licensing, or data
issues late — when fixes are costly or impossible.

Legal teams lack visibility.  
Product teams lack clear signals.  
Risk shows up too late.

---

### The goal
Create an AI reporting flow that:
- Surfaces risk early
- Explains issues in plain language
- Supports human decision-making

This project focuses on **trust, clarity, and accountability**.

---

### What I built
- A reporting flow for AI-generated audits
- Clear status states (flagged, pending, resolved)
- Visible data gaps instead of hidden failures
- A legal review queue with suggested actions

This is a **design and systems-thinking MVP** —
not a production backend.

---

### How it works (at a glance)
1. An AI report is generated
2. Risks are flagged with context
3. Missing data is shown clearly
4. Humans review and decide next steps

## Trust Signals & QA

{% include trust-signals.html %}

---

## What I tested
- Core user paths (report → review → decision)
- Status clarity under time pressure
- Error and empty states
- Hand-off points between AI and humans

---

## What I didn’t test (yet)
- Real legal team workflows
- Large-scale data volume
- Automated policy ingestion

These are documented intentionally and would be
next steps in a production build.

---

## Why this matters
You don’t have to trust the AI —
you can see what it’s doing.
